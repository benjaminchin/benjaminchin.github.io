							<p>This is a script I created when I was working at Bounce U during a summer. There was no set schedule, and my shifts were different each week. As such, I found myself manually checking the schedule, then creating a Google Calendar event for each and every shift I had. This became tedious, and I sometimes made mistakes with the date or time. As such, I decied to write this python script to do the job for me. This way, it is not only easier, but it also eliminates the possibility of human error. The script was run with Windows Task Scheduler every two weeks.</p>
							<p><b>Libraries: </b>Selenium, Google Calendar</p>
                            <p><b>How it works: </b>First, credentials are created to grant access for the script to use Google Calendar. Then, using Selenium, an instance of Chrome is created, directed to the schedule website, and logged in using email and password. Then, the date and times of each shift are obtained using defined methods get_month(), get_day(), get_hour(), and get_(minutes). Then an event variable is created as a dictionary with the corresponding date and times. Lastly, a Google Calendar event is created with the event variable</p>
